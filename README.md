👋 Hi, I’m @samelhusseini

🏢 I am a Software Engineer working at Google in Mountain View, California 🌞

👨‍💼 I am a tech lead manager working on Engineering Education infrastructure for programs such as [CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com) and [Applied Digital Skills](http://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com).
<br > In previous roles, I worked on 
- [Scratch for CS First](https://csfirst.withgoogle.com/project/editor), a version of the Scratch editor made specifically for CS First activities.
- [Blockly](https://github.com/google/blockly), an open source library for building block-based visual programming interfaces.

🏢 Prior to Google I worked at Microsoft for 5 years on a number of products including Windows, Visual Studio and [MakeCode](https://makecode.com).

⛷️ In my spare time I like to make things, ⚡ laser cutting and 3d printing 🖨️ top the list!
